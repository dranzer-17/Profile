## Introduction

Automatic chord recognition is a key task in music information retrieval. This project provides a user-friendly interface for chord classification from audio, using deep learning for accurate predictions.

## Features

*   **Audio Upload:** Supports various audio formats (WAV, MP3, etc.).
*   **Chroma Feature Extraction:** Extracts chroma features using Librosa.
*   **Deep Learning Model:** Employs a pre-trained deep learning model for classification.
*   **Streamlit Interface:** Interactive web interface for easy use.

## Installation

1.  **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/chord-classification.git`
2.  **Navigate:** `cd chord-classification`
3.  **Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    *   `python3 -m venv .venv`
    *   `source .venv/bin/activate` (or equivalent for your OS)
4.  **Install Dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`  (Create `requirements.txt` using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all project dependencies).

## Usage

1.  **Run:** `streamlit run src/app.py`  (Make sure you're in the correct directory containing `app.py`).
2.  **Access:** Open the provided URL in your browser (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
3.  **Upload:** Select an audio file.
4.  **Predict:** The app will process the audio and display the predicted chords.

## Model Training

(Details about the model architecture, training data, process, and evaluation metrics.  Create a separate `model_training.md` file for this and link it here.)

For example:  "See [model_training.md](model_training.md) for details on model architecture, training process, and evaluation."

## Dataset

(Information about the dataset used, including source, characteristics, and preprocessing steps.  Create a separate `dataset.md` file for this and link it here.)

For example:  "See [dataset.md](dataset.md) for details on the dataset used in this project."

## Future Work

*   Real-time processing
*   Improved model accuracy
*   Chord visualization

**Key Changes and Explanations:**

*   **Corrected `streamlit run` command:** The path issue is addressed.  The user needs to navigate to the directory containing `app.py` *before* running `streamlit run src/app.py`  OR use the correct relative path from the project's root directory.
*   **`requirements.txt` Clarification:**  Added a note explaining how to create the `requirements.txt` file.
*   **Model Training and Dataset:**  Emphasized the use of separate `.md` files for these sections to keep the README clean. Added example links and instructions on how to create and link these files.
*   **General Improvements:**  Minor wording and formatting adjustments for clarity and consistency.

**Important Next Steps:**

1.  **Create `requirements.txt`:**  Install all the required Python libraries for your project (Streamlit, Librosa, TensorFlow/Keras, etc.).  Then, in your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory and run: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
2.  **Create `model_training.md`:**  Document the details of your model training process.  What architecture did you use?  What dataset?  What were the training parameters?  What were the results?
3.  **Create `dataset.md`:**  Describe the dataset you used.  Where did it come from?  What kind of data does it contain?  Did you do any preprocessing?
4.  **Replace Placeholders:**  Make sure to replace the placeholder information in the README with your actual details (your name, email, LinkedIn profile, etc.).
5.  **Commit Everything:**  Commit all the changes (including the new `.md` files and `requirements.txt`) to your GitHub repository.

By following these instructions, you'll have a complete and professional README for your project.# Profile
